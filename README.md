# Professional Portfolio - Advanced CSS

## Description 

Implementing flex styling in css to create a responsive web page that displays my profile picture and bio, current work, and contact information.

[Deployed webpage](https://marikokaku.github.io/professional-portfolio/)

## Installation 

Using only html and css, flex and media queries help make this web page responsive and transferable to use on different size screens. 

## Problems

Problems I did not figure out: 

* Formatting project section to be responsive as a whole
* Media query styling for smaller screen sizes
